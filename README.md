# poster-session-2015
## Computer Science poster session, April 2015.
I made this poster to present at RPI's Computer Science department poster session in April 2015.  It concerns research I did regarding plankton classification with deep convolutional neural networks.  

The convolutional neural network drawing, convnet.{png, svg} is my own work and was created in Inkscape.

The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute logo is available from:

The poster is based on the beamerthemeRochester.sty template created by Till Tantau.

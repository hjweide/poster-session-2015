      \begin{block}{Problem Statement}
        The abundance of different plankton species in lakes serves as a key indicator to determine the health of an aquatic ecosystem.
        Unfortunately, collecting and classifying these organisms by species is a challenging task, even for trained experts.  Thus,
        to determine the distribution of plankton across a lake, experts have to spend tedious hours manually classifying plankton by
        species.  We wish to streamline this process by developing a system that is capable of automatically classifying these organisms.
        By doing so, we aim to allow biologists to classify organisms at rates that are currently impossible because of the
        time-consuming nature of the task.  This would allow them to study the distribution of millions of plankton across a lake.  In
        addition, these distributions could be studied at multiple depths and at different points in time to provide a spatial-temporal
        map of species across a lake.  This information could provide biologists with novel insights into aquatic ecosystems on a scale
        that is currently infeasible.  Additionally, by collaborating with researchers from the arts and simulation sciences, we hope to
        use our system to allow them to develop a new interactive visualization of the plankton populations present in a lake.
      \end{block}

      \begin{block}{Data}
        We are currently collecting data to build a plankton dataset from the species present in Lake George.  Eventually this data
        will form the core of our training data.  Until this dataset is complete, however, we are working with a very recent dataset
        made available through a Kaggle competition to develop our classification algorithms.  Below we show images from both datasets.
        On the left are images from the Kaggle dataset, and on the right are images from the dataset that is currently being collected
        at Lake George.  All the organisms in the same row belong to the same class.  Note that two organisms from the same species
        do not necessarily belong to the same class.  The reason for this is that a separation at the species level is often too coarse
        for biologists to draw accurate conclusions, and hence there are different organisms from the same species that need to be
        classified into separate classes.  This is why there are classes in both datasets that are visually very similar.

      \begin{block}{The Learning Model}
        To learn the plankton classification model, we use a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN).  Recently, DCNNs have improved
        the state-of-the-art on a wide variety of vision-related tasks.  Unlike traditional classification techniques that rely on
        hand-crafted features such as the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) or the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), DCNNs
        incorporate the feature selection into the learning model, thereby learning its own feature descriptor specific to the problem.
        This gives the learning model much more freedom in what information it decides to use in its final decision function, because
        it is trained on raw pixel data directly.

      \begin{block}{Extending the Classifier}
        Typically, when a learning model is designed, the set of classes to be separated is fixed ahead of time and remains fixed once
        the model goes into use.  For our application, however, this is not the case.  Specifically, the distribution of plankton across
        a lake changes based on factors such as water depth, temperature, and seasonal changes.  For these reasons, it is important
        that our learning model be extensible to new classes.  Unfortunately, deep learning models are typically very expensive to train,
        and thus we wish to avoid retraining the entire model.  Recent research has shown that it may be possible to use the lower
        convolutional layers of the DCNN as a generic visual feature extractor, thus allowing us to retrain only the higher-level
        fully-connected layers when a new class has to be added.
